**DisablePhantoms** is a Minecraft mod that prevents phantoms from spawning. 

Note that this makes it impossible to acquire phantom membranes.  This means that you will not be able to repair the elytra or create potions of slow falling.  If this is undesirable, check out the [Better Phatoms][bet] mod instead.

Another alternative is to use the new `doInsomnia` game rule, although this is only available since 1.15.

The advantage of using DisablePhantoms over the new game rule or other mods is that it disables phantoms in all of your worlds, period, as long as you have the mod loaded.  The alternatives have to be configured on a per-world basis.

Install the mod by dropping its jar file into `.minecraft/mods`. Requires Minecraft Forge.
